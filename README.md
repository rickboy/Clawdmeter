# Clawdmeter

A small ESP32 dashboard I made for my desk to keep an eye on Claude Code usage.

It runs on a [Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-2.16](https://docs.waveshare.com/ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-2.16) and pairs with my laptop over Bluetooth, and the splash screen plays pixel-art Clawd animations that get
busier when your usage rate climbs. The two side buttons send Space and
Shift+Tab over BLE HID for Claude Code's voice mode and mode-toggle shortcuts.

The Clawd animations come from [claudepix](https://claudepix.vercel.app), [@amaanbuilds](https://x.com/amaanbuilds)'s library of pixel-art Clawd sprites, check it out, it's lovely.

## Screens

The device boots into the splash and stays there until you press the middle (PWR) button, which cycles between Usage and Bluetooth. Tap the screen anywhere (except the Reset zone on the Bluetooth screen) to flip back to the splash; tap again to dismiss it.

|              Splash               |              Usage              |                Bluetooth                |
| :-------------------------------: | :-----------------------------: | :-------------------------------------: |
| ![Splash](screenshots/splash.png) | ![Usage](screenshots/usage.png) | ![Bluetooth](screenshots/bluetooth.png) |
|   Splash; touch-toggle anytime    | Session and weekly utilization  |    Connection status and bond reset     |

While the splash is up, the middle button cycles animations instead of screens. The firmware also auto-rotates every 20 s within the current usage-rate group, so a long stretch on the splash isn't just one Clawd on loop.

## Hardware

- [Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-2.16](https://docs.waveshare.com/ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-2.16) — ESP32-S3R8, 2.16" 480×480 AMOLED (CO5300 QSPI), CST9220 cap touch, AXP2101 PMU + Li-Po battery, QMI8658 IMU
- USB-C cable for flashing firmware and charging
- 3.7V Li-Po battery (MX1.25 2-pin connector, optional)

## Prerequisites

- [PlatformIO CLI](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation/index.html) — for building and flashing firmware
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 18+ and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) — for the daemon
- Claude Code with an active subscription

Linux additionally requires `bluetoothctl` / `busctl` (BlueZ stack). Windows and macOS use the Node daemon which handles BLE natively.

## Flash the firmware

Connect the device via USB-C. It appears as a serial port (`/dev/ttyACM0` on Linux, `COM*` on Windows — check Device Manager).

**Windows:**
```powershell
.\flash.ps1 COM3
```

**Linux:**
```bash
./flash.sh /dev/ttyACM0
```

## Bluetooth pairing

The daemon pairs automatically on first run — no manual pairing needed on Windows or Linux.

The device MAC address is shown on the Bluetooth screen (press middle PWR button to cycle to it) if you ever need it.

## Install the daemon

The daemon polls your Claude usage every 60 seconds and sends it to the display over BLE. It auto-connects and reconnects without manual pairing.

**Windows** — creates a startup shortcut (no admin required):
```powershell
.\install.ps1
```

Then start it now without waiting for a reboot:
```powershell
schtasks /Run /TN ClaudeUsageDaemon
```

Check status: `schtasks /Query /TN ClaudeUsageDaemon /FO LIST`

Check it's running: `Get-Process node`

View logs (run visibly in a terminal):
```powershell
cd daemon && node index.js
```

Uninstall: `.\install.ps1 -Remove`

---

**Linux** — installs as a systemd user service:
```bash
./install.sh
systemctl --user start claude-usage-daemon
```

Check status: `systemctl --user status claude-usage-daemon`

View logs: `journalctl --user -u claude-usage-daemon -f`

## How it works

1. The daemon reads your Claude Code OAuth token from `~/.claude/.credentials.json`.
2. It makes a minimal API call to `api.anthropic.com/v1/messages` — one token of Haiku, basically free.
3. The usage numbers come straight out of the response headers (`anthropic-ratelimit-unified-5h-utilization` and friends).
4. The daemon connects to the ESP32 over BLE and writes a JSON payload to the GATT RX characteristic.
5. The firmware parses it and updates the LVGL dashboard.
6. The firmware also tracks the rate of change of session % over a 5-minute window and picks splash animations from the matching mood group.
7. The two side buttons are independent of all of this — they send Space and Shift+Tab as BLE HID keyboard input to the paired host directly.

## Physical buttons

The board has three side buttons. Left and right do the same thing on every screen; the middle button is screen-aware.

| Button           | GPIO         | Function                                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Left**         | GPIO 0       | Hold to send Space (Claude Code voice-mode push-to-talk)       |
| **Middle** (PWR) | AXP2101 PKEY | Cycle screens (Usage ↔ Bluetooth); on splash, cycle animations |
| **Right**        | GPIO 18      | Press to send Shift+Tab (Claude Code mode toggle)              |

Space and Shift+Tab go out as standard BLE HID keyboard reports, so they trigger in whatever window has focus on the paired host — not just Claude Code.

## BLE protocol

The device advertises a custom GATT service alongside the standard HID keyboard service:

|                            | UUID                                   |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Data Service**           | `4c41555a-4465-7669-6365-000000000001` |
| RX Characteristic (write)  | `4c41555a-4465-7669-6365-000000000002` |
| TX Characteristic (notify) | `4c41555a-4465-7669-6365-000000000003` |
| **HID Service**            | `00001812-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb` |

JSON payload format (written to RX):

```json
{ "s": 45, "sr": 120, "w": 28, "wr": 7200, "st": "allowed", "ok": true }
```

Fields: `s` = session %, `sr` = session reset (minutes), `w` = weekly %, `wr` = weekly reset (minutes), `st` = status, `ok` = success flag.

## Recompiling fonts

The `firmware/src/font_*.c` files are pre-compiled LVGL bitmap fonts. Sizes
are roughly 1.9× larger than the Panlee 165 PPI panel this project started on,
to match the 314 PPI of the 2.16" AMOLED.

```bash
npm install -g lv_font_conv
```

Generate each one (one at a time — `lv_font_conv` doesn't like loop-driven invocations) with `--no-compress` (required for LVGL 9):

```bash
# Tiempos Text (titles, 56px)
lv_font_conv --font assets/TiemposText-400-Regular.otf -r 0x20-0x7E \
  --size 56 --format lvgl --bpp 4 --no-compress \
  -o firmware/src/font_tiempos_56.c --lv-include "lvgl.h"

# Styrene B (large numbers 48, panel labels 28, small text 24, minimal 20)
for size in 48 28 24 20; do
  lv_font_conv --font assets/StyreneB-Regular.otf -r 0x20-0x7E \
    --size $size --format lvgl --bpp 4 --no-compress \
    -o firmware/src/font_styrene_${size}.c --lv-include "lvgl.h"
done

# DejaVu Sans Mono (32px, with spinner Unicode chars)
lv_font_conv --font assets/DejaVuSansMono.ttf \
  -r 0x20-0x7E,0xB7,0x2026,0x2722,0x2733,0x2736,0x273B,0x273D \
  --size 32 --format lvgl --bpp 4 --no-compress \
  -o firmware/src/font_mono_32.c --lv-include "lvgl.h"
```

**Important:** `lv_font_conv` v1.5.3 outputs LVGL 8 format. Each generated file must be patched for LVGL 9 compatibility:

1. Remove `#if LVGL_VERSION_MAJOR >= 8` guards around `font_dsc` and the font struct
2. Remove the `.cache` field from `font_dsc`
3. Add `.release_glyph = NULL`, `.kerning = 0`, `.static_bitmap = 0` to the font struct
4. Add `.fallback = NULL`, `.user_data = NULL` to the font struct

Without these patches, fonts compile but render as invisible.

## Converting Lucide icons

The UI uses a small set of [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) icons (bluetooth + battery states) converted to RGB565 / RGB565A8 C arrays for LVGL.

```bash
node tools/png_to_lvgl.js assets/icon_bluetooth_48.png icon_bluetooth_data ICON_BLUETOOTH_WIDTH ICON_BLUETOOTH_HEIGHT
```

Default tint is white (`0xFFFFFF`); Lucide PNGs ship as black-on-transparent and would render invisible against the dark UI without it. Pass `--no-tint` for pre-coloured artwork like the logo. Battery icons use RGB565A8 (alpha plane) so they blend cleanly over the splash; the rest are baked RGB565 over the panel colour. Paste the converter output into `firmware/src/icons.h`.

## Splash animations

The animations come from [claudepix.vercel.app](https://claudepix.vercel.app),
a library of Clawd sprites. `tools/scrape_claudepix.js` evaluates the
site's JavaScript in a Node VM to pull out frame data and palettes, then
`tools/convert_to_c.js` turns everything into RGB565 C arrays and writes
`firmware/src/splash_animations.h`.

To re-pull (e.g. when the source library updates):

```bash
node tools/scrape_claudepix.js
node tools/convert_to_c.js
pio run -d firmware -t upload
```

See `tools/README.md` for details.
